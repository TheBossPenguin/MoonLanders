# MoonLanders

Welcome to MoonLanders, a video game made by Marcus Ho and Shehryar Ur Rehman.

This game encapsulates the original game of Space Racers and adds different levels of difficulty that scale with asteroid speed. Additionally, 80's style graphics were implemented using BRAM blocks which are initially set to the contents of .mif files that hold the colour values to be displayed. We currently have three levels available as well as a Start and End screen. To play, you will need a DE1-SoC FPGA board with four keys KEY[0] to KEY[4]. KEY[0] is the start game button, KEY[1] is the reset game button, and KEY[2] and KEY[3] are the up and down buttons to control the rocket respectively. Dodge all the asteroids and make it to the moon to win!
